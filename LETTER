Dear MATSUDA Takashi,

I found you post about building android apps in termux

https://gist.github.com/tmatz/817bf03433e059bf89c63dc33f286ccb#5-replace-aapt2

which helped med build an apache cordova app

Thank you very much.

I am trying to figure out what this command does:

jar -u -f {} -C /usr/bin aapt2

But I have not been able to find any contact information on you.

I hope that you have time to contact me

mail@zero-status.net

Kind regards
